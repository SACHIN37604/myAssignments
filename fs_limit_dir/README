Limit directory size:
1. generate.cpp and generate.hpp 
     - Generate class implementation.
	 - It creates Directory structure  

2. limitDirSize.cpp and limitDirSize.hpp
	 - LimitDirSize class implementation
	 - The utility keep the files/directories whose cumulative size does not cross the given size and delete the rest of the files/directories.
	 - The oldest files are deleted

3. test.cpp
     - test(CheckSize) for Directory size i.e. directory size after performing delete operation should be less than or equal to given size
     - test(OldestFileCheck) for delete function module i.e. Oldest files should be deleted (based on modification time)

4. Makefile
     - make: automatic building your code with cpp
	 - make clean: clean compiled files
